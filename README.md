# Gif of the Day - single page app

## MVP
This app will be fetching the trending gifs of the day from the Giphy API
and will display results to user. The app will be designed with a focus on
modularity as features/functions might be removed/added as requirements change.

## STRETCH GOALS
Add React Router functionality so that user is able to switch between trending 
gifs of the day results page and user's saved favorites page. User will be able
to select their favorite gifs in results page and store them to view later.
Firebase will likely be used for this.

React.js (17.0.2) and npm (6.14.9) will be used for this project.
